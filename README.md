# Salesforce Challenge

## Guidelines:


- 1. Setup a new free salesforce org

- 2. Write an hourly job that syncs new content from r/aww (or any other favorite sub) into a custom object, maintain the newest posts at any given time by dropping older posts. 

Note: (just in case you didn't know Reddit's "feed" API is super easy to access by appending ".json" to any page; see: https://www.reddit.com/r/aww.json)

- 3. Make this content visible by creating a LWC, in such control limit the number of records to 40.
 
- 4. r/aww is very image based, display those images on the record when viewed.
